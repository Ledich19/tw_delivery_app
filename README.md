## for launch all project

1. Open the folder containing your project.
2. Navigate to the `server` folder using the command `cd server` in your command prompt or terminal. This assumes that your project has a `server` folder that contains the server-side code.
3. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can check their presence by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v`, respectively. If they are not installed, you can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and proceed with the installation.
4. Run the command `npm install` or `npm i` to install all the project dependencies. This command will install all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file.
5. After the installation is complete, execute the command `npm start` to launch the project in production mode. If you want to run the project in development mode, use the command `npm run dev`. Refer to your project's documentation to determine which available scripts to run.
Example commands in the command prompt or terminal:
  Replace `path_to_project_folder` with the actual path to the folder where your project is located.
```
cd path_to_project_folder/server
npm install
npm start
```
